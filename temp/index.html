        <h2 id="paradox">üîç Exploring the Paradox of Perceptual Comfort</h2>
        <p>
          Can we build a web that puts users‚Äîbeyond just standards‚Äîin control of their own comfort and needs?
        </p>
        <p>
          Comfort and accessibility needs are deeply diverse and contextual‚Äîyet they intersect in powerful, often surprising ways. In this buildathon, we collaboratively map and model these overlaps into open, adaptable design patterns that reduce sensory and cognitive friction‚Äîwhile remaining lightweight and realistic for developers to adopt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, perceptual comfort isn't a fixed metric, but an evolving dialogue between users, systems, and design that cares.

        <p>
          Over two weeks, we'll explore, prototype, and document our findings. Each day, we'll focus on a different aspect of comfort‚Äîvisual, auditory, cognitive, emotional‚Äîand how it can be expressed in web design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants will work in small teams to create low-fidelity prototypes, share insights, and iterate based on feedback. The goal is to create a collective sketchbook of ideas that can be built upon long after the event ends.

        <h2 id="what-lives">What lives in the Comfort Commons?</h2>
        <p>
          Field notes from lived experiences. Parallel studies from other industries. Low-res wireframes. Hand-drawn interface ideas. Moodboards, thought maps, and design patterns still in formation. Whether it's a sketch inspired by a medical shift from "compliance to care," or a simple moment where you felt softly seen online‚Äîeverything counts. The Comfort Commons is not a gallery of finished products, but a shared sketchbook of possibilities in progress.
