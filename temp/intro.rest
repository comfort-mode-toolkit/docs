Welcome to the Comfort Mode Toolkit Documentation
====================================================


The Comfort Mode Toolkit is a collaborative, open-source project focused on making the web more comfortable and accessible for everyone.  
We believe comfort is not just a luxury—it's a fundamental part of digital inclusion and wellbeing.

Whether you're a designer, developer, researcher, or someone passionate about accessibility and comfort, you'll find something here to help you learn, contribute, and make a difference.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress!  
We're always adding new findings and encourage you to contribute your insights, questions, and feedback.
