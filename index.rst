Comfort Mode Toolkit

**Making the web more perceptually comfortable and inclusive.**

The Comfort Mode Toolkit is a collaborative, open-source research and implementation project. Our goal is to provide tools that automatically tune digital interfaces for better accessibility and visual comfort.

Currently, the toolkit features **CM-Colors**, a powerful library and CLI for automated color contrast tuning.
